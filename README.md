# Advent of Code 2022

This is the repo for the [funniest game](https://adventofcode.com) in Christmast time ever.  
I'll be publishing my solutions in Python, taking it as an opportunity to improve my coding skills.

I'm trying to write smooth, readable code, so if you have any suggestion, please feel free to [contact me](teo.martinelli97@gmail.com)
